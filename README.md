# systemd-boot-conversion

**Everything is gone?!**
Yes - for now. With the shift that's happening in [Fedora 39](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/39/ChangeSet#Clean_Systemd-boot_installs) and newer I've decided to remove the contents of this repo and wait untill those changes have landed to see what I can/have to work with.

Stick around to find out!
